# Kickstarting with Excel

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover fundraising trends. This analyis was performed on a large data set but will specifically look at Theater Plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges
  My analysis concludes that Louise should launch her Kickstarter in May with a goal less than or equal to $15,000. While there were no challenges in the data I explored, the conclusions could be improved with a larger data set. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  The analysis shows that May is the best month for a successful fundraising launch date. April-August have high success rates and December seems to be the least desirable month to launch. Overall it seems the launch date does not effect the success as much as as the fundraiing goal. 
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The analysis shows the lower the fundraising goal the more successful the fundraising campaign will be. It is in Louise's best interest to keep her costs low and aim for a fundraising goal less than $19,999. There is some data to suggest that fundraising goals between $35,000-$45,000 could be successful but there are only 9 projects in the range which is not a large enough sample. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  The main challenge is working with limited data for fundraising goals greater than $20,000. Of the 694 succesful projects only 21 had fundraising goals greater than $20,000. The launch date data is not as conclusive with multiple months being successful. 

## Results

- Two conclusions about the outcomes based on launch date are that May is the most successful month and Decemember is the least successful month. Louise should aim to launch her kickstarter during May. 

- Two conclusions about the outcomes based on fundraising goal are that the lower the amount needed the higher the success rate. A fundraising goal of $45,000 or more is extremely likely to fail. 

- The data is limited in theater plays with goals greater than $20,000. Perhaps if there were more data sets in this range the data would show a different conclusion. 

- In addition to the graphs I created Louise may want to explore data specific to her country of interest and go more in depth with theater plays by launch date.
